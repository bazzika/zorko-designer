## What should I know before I get started ?

### Design Decisions

Designer use redux+react stack. Visualization rendering performed by vega library.

 Application consist within next layers

 1. Presenter - control access to state data structures read/modification operations
 1. Slices -  modules  provide immutable reducer and actions to manipulate within app state slice
 1. Selectors - modules with read only access to all app state, provides caching functionality
 1. Components - 'dummy' components, which has no relations for `Slices` and `Selectors`, just pure react components
 1. Containers - react components connected to store, actions hardly use `Selectors`

#### Presenters

Classes around plain state object used by application root state, their propose is to incapsulate read/update operations
over plain state object, so any consumers can do state changes without burden of data massaging object directly.

Main consumers of presenters in applications are `Reducers`, secondary consumers are `Selectors`

 `Presenters`  are very important to cover with unit tests, because they are in a core of Application. See [Unit Test](#unit-tests)

### Slices

Each slice is a module which exposes immutable reducer and functions for actions creators

### Selectors

Selector functions for read-only operation over root app state.
Should use cache to optimize React re-rendering.

### Components

React components, should't have dependencies to Redux, try to keep them as simple as possible, use functional components only and hooks

### Containers

Components which have dependencies to redux (actions, selectors etc)
